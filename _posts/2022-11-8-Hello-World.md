# What is animal welfare?

Animal welfare means how an animal is coping with the conditions in which it lives. An animal is in a good state of welfare if (as indicated by scientific evidence) it is healthy, comfortable, well-nourished, safe, able to express innate behavior, and if it is not suffering from unpleasant states such as pain, fear, and distress. Good animal welfare requires disease prevention and veterinary treatment, appropriate shelter, management, nutrition, humane handling, and humane slaughter. Animal welfare refers to the state of the animal; the treatment that an animal receives is covered by other terms such as animal care, animal husbandry, and humane treatment. Protecting an animal's welfare means providing for its physical and mental needs.

Ensuring animal welfare is a human responsibility that includes consideration for all aspects of animal well-being, including proper housing, management, nutrition, disease prevention and treatment, responsible care, humane handling, and, when necessary, humane euthanasia.

There are numerous perspectives on animal welfare that are influenced by a person's values and experiences. There are also various means of measuring animal welfare, including (but not limited to) health, productivity, behavior, and physiological responses.


# Why should we do it?

Animal welfare is closely linked to animal health, the health and wellbeing of people, and the sustainability the of socio-economic and ecological systems. We think there are several reasons for participating in animal welfare, some of them which are : 

- Mainataining a proper ecosystem : Between 1992 and 2007, population of vultures sharply declined, at 97-99 percent of the scavenger dying, due to human carelessness. The culprit was diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administered to cattle. This harmed the balance of the ecosystem, which was necessary for the health of the participants

- Controlling stray and invasive populations : Many environmentalists agree that the rise in populations of stray animals, was due to improper disposals of the cattle carcasses' , coupled with improper sterilization.

- Public health and safety concerns : Many diseases jump from animals to human, and proper management is necessary to avoid that. Also, stray and improperly cared animals are often involved in accidents, leading to harm.

- Dignity of life : We believe that like us, animals are capable of emotion and pain,  and deserve a dignified life, especially when often human decisions has led to the harm.
